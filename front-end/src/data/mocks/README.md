## Chances

When it comes to getting back to nature, different people are looking for different experiences. We're calling these experiences 'chances' - chances to get 'back to nature'. Some chances are pretty much always available. However, other chances come only once a month, maybe even just once in a lifetime. Knowing that you might me missing out on unique chances, will make it easier to put away time for nature.

### Chance Requirements

Chances have certain requirements of its environment. Some requirements may be related to weather conditions; others to the amount of people in the area at a given time. All of these values can be somewhat predicted based on historic data (and, eventually, intent shown through use of this application). Once all the environmental conditions are met, we can say that the chance has arisen.

### Chance locations

Chances may also arise in certain locations. This is different from the requirements, as the environment varies based on two core elements: time and space. Time is taken care of with predictions, and space is taken care of with locations. Locations can be mapped through three properties: longitude, latitude and radius. With clear locations in place, we're able to plan where to go, at what time; all informed through predictions made based on data. This makes for a better experience for anyone that wants to get back to nature.

## Predictions

The environmental conditions that form the requirements for chances can also be predicted. These predictions, in time series format, can be sent from a server to the application; allowing the user to discover the predicted rise of various chances at certain points in time. From there, trips can be planned, fishing sesisons can be planned - you get the point. Predictions also brings about a very important point - chances to get 'back to nature' are unique, and should be taken when they arise.

* Notes *

The requirements of chances, and time series data from predictions, both take as input different types of 'environmental conditions'. A beginning list of such environmental condition types may be:

- Weather (cloudy, raining, temperature, etc.)
- Congestion (the amount of people, likely group types (tourists/locals), etc.)
- Date & time (seasonal cycles, daily cycles, cosmic cycles, etc.)
